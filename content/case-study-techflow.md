# Case Study: How We Helped a Series B Startup Fix Their Broken Roadmap (And Increase Revenue 40%)

**Company:** TechFlow (Series B fintech, $8M ARR)  
**Problem:** Roadmap misalignment, slow shipping, conflicting stakeholder priorities  
**Timeline:** 4-month engagement  
**Result:** Revenue increased 40%, team velocity +60%, stakeholder satisfaction 9.2/10

## The Situation

TechFlow had product-market fit. They were growing fast. But they were chaotic.

Their CEO wanted growth features. Engineering wanted to refactor technical debt. Sales wanted a specific feature for their top customer. Customer Success wanted improvements to the onboarding flow.

Nobody agreed on what to build next.

The result: 
- Features shipped slowly (10 weeks for something that should take 4)
- Stakeholders were constantly frustrated
- The team wasn't motivated (building things that felt arbitrary)
- Revenue growth had plateaued

They hired us to fix it.

## Our Audit (Week 1-2)

We ran stakeholder interviews and found:

1. **No shared strategy.** Everyone had a different idea of what the product should be in 12 months.
2. **No shared metrics.** CEO measured by revenue. Engineering measured by technical debt reduction. Sales measured by customer retention. No common language.
3. **No communication framework.** Decisions happened in Slack. Reversals happened in meetings. Nobody knew what was actually committed.
4. **Engineering didn't trust product.** They felt like product was "throwing features at the wall."

This is incredibly common in Series B companies.

## The Framework We Built (Week 3-4)

### Step 1: Define Shared Strategy (2 days)

We held a 2-day strategy sprint with CEO, CTO, Head of Sales, Head of CS.

**The output:**
- **12-month vision:** "TechFlow becomes the #1 choice for mid-market fintech companies because we solve fraud detection better than anyone (problem solved: false positives down 90%)"
- **6-month themes:** 
  - Q1-Q2: Build fraud detection suite (main revenue driver)
  - Q3: Expand API ecosystem (growth for advanced customers)
  - Q4: Improve onboarding (reduce churn from 8% to 6%)

Every decision from then on was evaluated against these themes.

### Step 2: Create Shared Metrics Dashboard

We built a single dashboard:

| Metric | Target | Current | Trend | Owner | Connection to Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ARR | $11M | $8M | 📈 | CEO | Revenue growth theme |
| Customer Churn | 6% | 8% | 📉 | CS/Product | Onboarding improvements |
| Feature Velocity | 40 points/sprint | 25 points | 📈 | Eng | Roadmap clarity |
| Technical Debt Score | <20% | 35% | 📉 | CTO | Roadmap allocation |
| API Adoption | 30% | 5% | 📈 | Product | API ecosystem growth |
| Time-to-value (days) | 7 | 14 | 📉 | CS | Onboarding work |
| Fraud Detection Accuracy | 99% | 94% | 📈 | Eng | Core product theme |

**Key insight:** Everyone now saw how their work connected to the business outcome.

### Step 3: Build the Roadmap (Week 5)

We created a quarterly roadmap aligned to the strategy:

**Q1 Goals (Jan-Mar):**
1. **Ship fraud detection MVP** (Revenue goal | Owner: Eng)
   - Machine learning model
   - Integration with payment processor
   - Dashboard for merchants
   - Success metric: 94%+ accuracy on test set

2. **Improve onboarding flow** (Retention goal | Owner: Product/Design)
   - New welcome sequence
   - In-app contextual help
   - Video walkthroughs
   - Success metric: 7-day completion <2 days (vs current 14 days)

3. **Technical refactor phase 1** (Platform health | Owner: CTO)
   - Upgrade database layer
   - Improve API response times
   - Success metric: API p99 latency <200ms

**Q2 Goals (Apr-Jun):**
1. **Launch API marketplace** (Growth goal)
2. **Expand fraud detection** (Revenue goal)
3. **Implement customer health scoring** (Retention goal)

This wasn't 30 initiatives. It was 3 per quarter. Focused.

### Step 4: Create Accountability Framework

Every goal had:
- **Single owner** (not "co-owned")
- **Clear success metrics** (not "we'll know it when we see it")
- **Dependencies called out** (if X blocks Y)
- **Weekly status** (green/yellow/red)

The CTO owned technical refactor. Product owned onboarding. Engineering lead owned fraud detection. Everyone knew their lane.

### Step 5: Build Communication System

**Weekly (Every Monday):**
- Standup email (2 min read): What shipped, what's blocked, what's coming
- Shared dashboard updated (automated)

**Monthly (First Tuesday):**
- 1-hour stakeholder sync: Review metrics, discuss blockers, celebrate wins

**Quarterly (End of quarter):**
- 3-day roadmap review (metrics review, customer feedback, next quarter planning)

## The Results (4 Months In)

### Revenue
- **Target:** 15% growth ($9.2M ARR) 
- **Achieved:** 40% growth ($11.2M ARR)
- **Why:** Clear priorities meant engineering shipped fraud detection faster. Sales could close deals. Customers saw value.

### Velocity
- **Before:** 25 points/sprint
- **After:** 40 points/sprint (+60%)
- **Why:** Team wasn't second-guessing priorities. Clear roadmap meant less context switching.

### Stakeholder Alignment
- **CEO:** "Finally feels like there's a plan"
- **CTO:** "I trust that we're building the right thing"
- **Sales:** "I can set customer expectations now"
- **CS:** "Improvements are actually shipping"

Stakeholder satisfaction: 9.2/10

### Team Morale
Before: "Why are we building this?" Frustrated.  
After: "Here's why this matters to the business." Motivated.

## Key Lessons From This Engagement

1. **Shared metrics change behavior.** When engineering saw that faster feature velocity helped sales close deals, and that helped revenue, it aligned naturally.

2. **Clear ownership prevents gridlock.** When one person owned each goal, decisions got made faster. Less committee.

3. **Communication > complexity.** They didn't need complex tools. They needed a system: weekly updates, monthly syncs, quarterly planning. Done.

4. **Focus is a competitive advantage.** Saying no to 20 ideas so they could say yes to 3 created 40% revenue growth. Focus wins.

5. **Trust builds incrementally.** Month 1, they were skeptical. Month 2, cautiously optimistic. Month 3, fully aligned. It takes time.

## What Changed Long-Term

6 months after engagement ended:

- They maintained the roadmap discipline
- Stakeholder satisfaction stayed high (9.0/10)
- Revenue continued growing 15-20% quarterly
- Engineering velocity stabilized at 35-40 points/sprint
- They were able to hire faster (clear vision attracted talent)

## Would They Hire Again?

CEO quote: "This saved us. We were about to lose our best engineer because the roadmap was chaos. Now we're building a company."

## The Takeaway

You don't need fancy tools. You need:
1. **Shared strategy** (agreed destination)
2. **Shared metrics** (how we know we're winning)
3. **Shared roadmap** (what we're building and why)
4. **Clear communication** (weekly visibility)
5. **Regular review** (monthly + quarterly)

Most companies skip step 1 and wonder why nothing works.
