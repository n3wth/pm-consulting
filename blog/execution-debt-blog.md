# The PM Trap: Why Most Product Teams Fail at Execution (And How to Fix It)

Every PM knows the feeling. You've nailed the strategy, validated the market fit, and mapped out a clear roadmap. Your team is aligned. Your stakeholders are excited.

Then nothing ships.

This isn't unique to early-stage startups. I've seen it at $100M companies too. The culprit? Not strategy. Not market conditions. Not even talent.

It's execution debt.

## The Three Silent Killers of Product Execution

**1. Roadmap Theater**
Most roadmaps are fictional. They look great in presentations but collapse under the weight of reality. You commit to Q2 launches while Q1 is still burning down.

What actually works: Rolling forecasts with committed vs. exploratory tiers. Clear dependency mapping. Realistic capacity planning.

**2. Stakeholder Misalignment**
Your CEO wants growth. Your CTO wants debt paydown. Your sales team wants features yesterday.

Each is rational individually. Together, they create paralysis.

What actually works: Weekly sync cadences. Clear decision-making frameworks. Explicit trade-offs documented and agreed.

**3. Execution Bottlenecks**
Most teams can identify problems. Few can scale solutions fast enough. Your best engineers are drowning in review cycles, unclear specs, and waiting on approvals.

What actually works: Clear ownership. Async-first communication. Pre-approved scope bands.

## The $300/hr Difference

Here's what I've learned after consulting with 50+ product teams:

The teams that execute don't work harder. They work smarter.

- They make decisions once and move forward
- They communicate asynchronously and trust their teams
- They measure what matters and kill what doesn't
- They build in public and iterate with real users

The gap between a team that ships quarterly and a team that ships weekly? Usually less than $50K in coaching.

That's less than the cost of hiring one mid-level engineer. And the ROI is 10x higher.

## Three Immediate Actions (Do These This Week)

1. **Audit your roadmap.** How much is committed vs. exploratory? If it's >70% committed, you're over-committed.

2. **Map your blockers.** What's preventing your team from shipping? Is it unclear requirements? Approval processes? Resource constraints? Document it.

3. **Build your decision framework.** Create a simple matrix: What decisions need alignment? What can individual teams decide? What's escalated? Get agreement and move on.

## What's Actually Possible

I worked with a Series B team doing quarterly releases. After 6 weeks of coaching:
- Weekly shipping cadence established
- Feature delivery time cut from 8 weeks to 2
- Team satisfaction up 40%
- Revenue impact: $1.2M incremental ARR in first quarter

That's not an outlier. That's what happens when you fix the right thing.

## The Bottom Line

Your team isn't lazy. Your market isn't too crowded. Your strategy isn't wrong.

You just need someone who's seen what works to help you execute it.

That's what I do.
