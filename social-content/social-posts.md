## Stat-Based Posts

### Post 1: Feature Adoption Gap
"65% of suggested features go unused. That's not a product problem. That's a *strategy* problem. Features people don't need don't get adopted. Features people don't know about don't get used. Strategy fixes this. [Read how](#)"

### Post 2: Decision Fatigue
"The average PM gets 50+ feature requests per quarter. With no prioritization framework, they're making 50 different decisions. That's decision fatigue. That's burnout. One framework—RICE—changes everything. Here's how: [Link](#)"

### Post 3: Churn Cost
"12% churn costs you 50% of your growth. You can hire all the sales reps you want—if customers are leaving, you're swimming upstream. The fix: Product strategy that keeps people. [Case study here](#)"

### Post 4: Kill the Roadmap
"Stop publishing detailed roadmaps. I know what you're thinking—'But we need to communicate vision.' Yes. But detailed roadmaps create false certainty and customer frustration when things slip. Use outcome-driven roadmaps instead. Flexibility. Transparency. Trust. [Thread: how to do this](#)"

### Post 5: RICE Isn't Perfect
"Every PM worships RICE. It's great. But RICE doesn't account for technical debt, platform health, or strategic bets. If you're using RICE, you're ignoring 30% of what actually matters. We add stakeholder impact and risk as weighted factors. [Here's the full framework](#)"

### Post 6: Alignment ≠ Agreement
"You don't need everyone to agree. You need everyone to understand the decision and commit to it. Consensus is slow. Clarity is fast. Get your stakeholders aligned, not agreeing. Huge difference. [How to do this in one meeting](#)"

### Post 7: TechFlow Story
"TechFlow was shipping features but losing deals. Why? Their sales cycle was 6 months instead of 4. Root cause: No product strategy. Every stakeholder wanted something different. We helped them define one strategy, align the team, and ship ruthlessly. Result: 35% faster GTM. 50% less churn. [Read the case study](#)"

### Post 8: The 200-Item Backlog
"Client came to us with 200 features in their backlog. 200! We spent a week researching. Turns out 180 of them didn't matter. We killed them. Not 'backlog.' Killed. The team moved 3x faster with clear priorities. Clarity beats options every time. [Here's how we did it](#)"

## Question-Based Posts

### Post 9: Quick Poll
"Your CEO asks: 'What are we building next?' Can you answer in one sentence? If not, you don't have a strategy. What would your one sentence be? [Thread: how to build yours](#)"

### Post 10: Engagement Hook
"What's your biggest product challenge? - Saying no to features - Aligning cross-functional teams - Getting engineering to commit - Something else? Reply. I read all of them and will share patterns. Let's solve this together. [#productmanagement](#)"
