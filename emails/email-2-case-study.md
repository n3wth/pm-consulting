# Email 2: Case Study + Value Demonstration

**Subject:** How this PM increased adoption 3x (case study)

**Preview:** The strategy mistake that was killing their product

Hi {First_Name},

Quick question: Have you completed the strategy audit yet?

(If not, no judgment—block 30 minutes today. You'll be glad you did.)

Today I want to share a real story about strategy done right.

**The situation:**

Sarah was a PM at a mid-sized B2B SaaS company. Her product had good technology but terrible adoption.

- 40% of customers never activated
- Churn was climbing
- Sales was blaming product
- Product was blaming sales

Sound familiar?

**What was broken:**

When I reviewed their strategy, the problem was obvious: **They didn't have one.**

They had a roadmap. A list of features. A "vision" (vague platitudes).

But no actual strategy.

**What we did:**

We spent 2 weeks rebuilding their strategy from scratch:

1. **Identified the real problem** - Not "engagement" (vague). Specific: "Users abandon during Week 2 because they don't see value before their trial ends."

2. **Defined the moat** - Not "better product" (everyone says that). Specific: Integration depth that takes competitors 18 months to replicate.

3. **Made trade-offs** - Said NO to enterprise (too expensive to support) and SMB (CAC didn't work). Focused entirely on mid-market.

4. **Connected to execution** - Rebuilt the roadmap around ONE goal: Get users to "aha moment" in <24 hours.

**The results (9 months later):**

- Activation: 40% → 78%
- Churn: 35% annual → 18% annual
- NPS: +15 points
- Revenue: 2.5x growth

**What changed?**

Not the product (mostly). Not the team.

The **strategy**. Clear. Focused. Connected to execution.

**Your turn:**

What's the one strategic gap holding your team back?

- Unclear problem definition?
- No real competitive advantage?
- Too many priorities (which means no priority)?
- Strategy disconnected from roadmap?
