# Email Sequence: PM Consulting 5-Email Nurture

## Email 1: Welcome + Value Prop

**Subject:** Welcome to PM Consulting - 3 frameworks that 100+ companies use

Hi [Name],

Welcome! I'm [Author], and I lead product consulting at PM Consulting.

You signed up because you're thinking about product strategy, prioritization, or roadmap planning. That's great. Most PMs we work with start there.

Here's what we know about successful product teams: They have clarity.

Clarity about:
- What to build next (not every feature request)
- Why they're building it (not just because leadership asked)
- How to communicate the plan (not confused stakeholders)

Without clarity, even great teams move slowly.

Over the next week, I'm going to share:
- How top SaaS companies use RICE to prioritize (Email 2)
- A framework for aligning stakeholders (Email 3)
- The template we use with clients (Email 4)
- A limited offer just for this email list (Email 5)

You're going to get frameworks, not fluff.

Let's start with a question: What's your biggest challenge right now?
- Saying no to feature requests?
- Aligning cross-functional stakeholders?
- Getting engineering to commit to timelines?

Reply to this email. I read every response.

Talk soon,
[Author]

P.S. If you work at a SaaS company with $5M+ ARR, we should probably talk about consulting. [Schedule 30-min call](#)

## Email 2: Case Study / Social Proof

**Subject:** How TechFlow cut sales cycles by 35% (and how you can too)

Hi [Name],

Remember when you said your challenge was [pain they mentioned]?

I wanted to share a case study. It's relevant.

TechFlow is a B2B analytics company. They were shipping features but moving slowly. Sales cycles were 6 months instead of 4.

The problem wasn't the product. It was the *direction*.

Each stakeholder (sales, engineering, customers) wanted something different. No shared vision. No prioritization framework.

We worked with them to:
1. Define a clear strategy in one sentence
2. Score their 200-item backlog using RICE framework
3. Align sales, engineering, and leadership on the plan

Result: Sales cycles dropped from 6 months to 3.9 months. That's 35% faster.

Setup time also dropped from 20 hours to 2 hours. Feature adoption improved 27%.

We wrote up the full case study with numbers and learnings: [Read the case study](#)

The pattern we see: When PMs get clarity on what to build, everything else gets easier.

More tomorrow,
[Author]

P.S. We're launching a new consulting program for Series B/C companies. Early pricing available this month only. [Learn more](#)

## Email 3: How-To / Educational Content

**Subject:** The RICE framework (your secret weapon for saying no)

Hi [Name],

You probably get 50+ feature requests per quarter.

Sales: "Customer X needs Feature A."
Engineering: "Feature B would make us 3x faster."
Customers: "Feature C is critical."
You: (internal screaming)

How do you choose?

Most PMs use gut feel. Some use politics. The best use frameworks.

RICE is our favorite. It stands for:
- Reach: How many users affected?
- Impact: How much does this move the needle?
- Confidence: How sure are you?
- Effort: How long to build?

Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Simple, right? Here's the magic: When you have real numbers, disagreement stops.

Sales says: "Feature A is critical."
You say: "Let's score it."
Engineering estimates 4 months. Reach is 50 users. Impact is 2x.
Score = (50 × 2 × 80%) / 4 = 20

Meanwhile, Feature B:
- Reach: 5,000 users
- Impact: 1x
- Confidence: 80%
- Effort: 2 months
Score = (5000 × 1 × 80%) / 2 = 2000

Feature B wins by 100x.

Data wins every time.

We put together a template you can use with your team: [Download the RICE template](#)

Use it this week. Let me know how it goes.

## Email 4: Limited Offer / Scarcity

**Subject:** 50% off consulting - Early February only

Hi [Name],

I mentioned we're launching our consulting program this quarter.

We're starting with 5 companies. Working intensively for 3-4 months on:
- Product strategy definition
- Prioritization framework setup
- Stakeholder alignment
- Roadmap planning
- Execution coaching

It's the work that moves the needle.

Our standard investment is $180K-$250K depending on scope.

For this email list (and only this month), we're offering **50% off first engagements**. That brings the cost to $90K-$125K. Still a significant investment, but it removes a barrier.

Spots are limited (5 companies total). We fill these fast.

If you're at a company with $5M+ ARR and facing strategic challenges, this might be worth a conversation.

[Schedule a consultation](#) - 30 minutes, no obligation.

What we'll discuss:
- Your current state (strategy clarity, execution, metrics)
- Your challenges (stakeholder alignment, prioritization, growth)
- Whether consulting makes sense (we'll be honest)
- If yes, what the engagement would look like

Sound good? [Let's talk](#)

P.S. Even if consulting isn't right for you, we're building a knowledge base of frameworks and templates. Join 500+ PMs who get weekly posts: [Subscribe to the blog](#)

## Email 5: Final CTA + Guarantee

**Subject:** Last chance: 50% off consulting (30 days only)

Hi [Name],

This is my last email in the sequence.

If you've made it this far, you probably resonated with something:
- The RICE framework (email 3)
- The TechFlow case study (email 2)
- Or you're thinking about product strategy (email 1)

Here's the reality: Most PMs don't have a framework. They're winging it.

And it costs them. Slower execution. Frustrated stakeholders. Missed growth.

The companies we work with get it right. They have clarity. Strategy. Alignment. And they move 2x faster as a result.

If you're ready to transform your product function, let's talk.

**50% off our consulting program ends [DATE].**

[Schedule a conversation](#) - 30 min, no strings attached.

Here's what we guarantee:
- We'll be honest if consulting is right for you
- You'll walk away with at least one insight (even if you don't hire us)
- If you do hire us, we'll ship results (not reports)

What's the worst that can happen? You get a free 30-min strategy conversation.

What's the best? You transform how your product team operates.

Worth an email, [Name]?
