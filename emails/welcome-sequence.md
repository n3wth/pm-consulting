# Email Sequence 2: Value Story (Day 3)

Subject: How TechFlow grew revenue 40% with a better roadmap

Body:

Hi [Name],

I worked with TechFlow (Series B fintech) when they were stuck. Same problem you might have:

❌ Engineering wanted technical debt work
❌ Sales wanted new features fast  
❌ CEO wanted revenue growth
❌ Nobody was aligned

They built a roadmap using the framework. Here's what changed:

✅ Shipped 2x faster (25 → 40 points/sprint)
✅ Revenue grew 40% ($8M → $11.2M ARR)
✅ Team morale improved visibly
✅ No more late-night conflicts about priorities

The secret? They stopped treating the roadmap as a feature list. Started treating it as a strategy document.

Want to see the full case study?

If you want help building this for your team, I'm still taking 2-3 consulting clients per month.

# Email Sequence 3: Objection Handler (Day 7)

Subject: "We already have a roadmap"

Body:

Hi [Name],

A lot of teams I talk to say: "We already have a roadmap. It's in Jira/Linear/Notion."

Here's the thing: Most roadmaps fail silently.

They look good in software. But they don't:
- Align stakeholders
- Clarify priorities
- Guide execution
- Adapt to change
- Build team motivation

A roadmap is only useful if it CHANGES how your team works.

If your team is shipping faster, stakeholders are aligned, and morale is high, you're good.

If not, you might need a different approach.

Either way, happy to help. [BOOK A CALL]
