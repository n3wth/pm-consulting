# Email 4: Success Story + Social Proof

**Subject:** Success story: Roadmap realignment increased velocity 40%

**Preview:** How one strategic change unlocked their entire team

---

Hi {First_Name},

Last story for you (then I'll stop bothering you, promise).

This one's about **Marcus**.

**The problem:**

Marcus was a Director of Product at a Series C startup. 60 engineers. 8 product teams.

Everything was... fine.

They shipped features. Customers were mostly happy. Revenue grew slowly.

But Marcus knew something was off:

- Teams felt busy but not productive
- Roadmap was a list of random features
- Nobody could explain why they were building what they were building
- "Strategy" was a 40-slide deck nobody referenced

**Sound familiar?**

**What we did:**

One thing. We **realigned the roadmap to strategy.**

Here's how:

**Step 1:** Defined 3 strategic pillars
- Pillar 1: Win enterprise (vs. mid-market focus)
- Pillar 2: Become multi-product (vs. single product)
- Pillar 3: Build platform defensibility (vs. features)

**Step 2:** Audited the roadmap
- 60% of features didn't support any pillar (!)
- They were "nice to haves" from customer requests
- Teams were building things that didn't matter

**Step 3:** Cut ruthlessly
- Killed 40% of roadmap items
- Reallocated resources to strategic initiatives
- Said NO to a lot of good ideas

**The results (6 months later):**

- Engineering velocity: +40% (same team, better focus)
- Strategic initiatives: All 3 shipped on time
- Team morale: Dramatically improved (they knew WHY they were building)
- Revenue impact: $3M new ARR from enterprise focus

**What changed?**

The team didn't get smarter. Resources didn't increase.

They just **focused on what actually mattered.**

**Your turn:**

Ask yourself:

- If you killed 40% of your roadmap, what would you kill?
- Would your product be better or worse?
- Do your teams know WHY they're building what they're building?

**If you're not sure, let's talk.**

I still have a few strategy session slots open this week: **[Calendar Link]**

We'll look at your roadmap and I'll tell you exactly what's working (and what's not).

No cost. No obligation. Just honest feedback.

P.S. This is my last "pushy" email. After this, I'll still send you occasional strategy insights, but I'll stop asking you to book time. Fair?
