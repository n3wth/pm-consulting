Hi {First_Name},

Your **Product Strategy Checklist** is attached.

Before you dive in, quick intro: I'm Oliver. I've spent years working with product teams from early-stage startups to Google-scale companies, reviewing and rebuilding product strategies.

Here's what I've learned: **Most product strategies are actually broken.**

Not "needs polish" broken. Fundamentally broken.

The checklist you just downloaded will help you diagnose exactly where yours stands.

**How to use it:**

1. **Block 30 minutes** - Go through each section honestly
2. **Score yourself** - Don't cheat (nobody's watching)
3. **Focus on gaps** - The lowest-scoring sections are where you'll get most value

**What to expect:**

If you scored **75%+**: You're ahead of most teams. Focus on execution.

If you scored **50-75%**: You have work to do. We can help.

If you scored **<50%**: Your strategy needs a rebuild. Let's talk.

**Next step:**

After you've completed the audit, reply to this email with your score. I'll send you specific recommendations for your situation.

(Seriously—I respond to every email. I'm not a bot.)

Looking forward to hearing from you.

— Oliver

P.S. If the checklist was helpful, you'll love what's coming next. I'll share how top product teams actually build strategy (vs. what they put in decks).
