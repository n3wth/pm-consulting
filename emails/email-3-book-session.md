# Email 3: Book a Free Strategy Session

**Subject:** Let's fix your product strategy (free 30-min session)

**Preview:** No pitch, no sales. Just honest feedback on your strategy.

Hi {First_Name},

By now you've (hopefully) completed the strategy checklist and read about Sarah's 3x adoption increase.

Question: **What's holding you back from similar results?**

I'm guessing it's one of these:

- ❌ Your strategy is broken, but you don't know where to start
- ❌ You have good ideas, but can't get executive alignment
- ❌ You're too busy executing to step back and think strategically
- ❌ You're not sure if your "strategy" is actually a strategy

If any of these resonate, **let's talk.**

**Here's what I'm offering:**

A free 30-minute strategy session where we'll:

1. **Review your current strategy** (or lack thereof)
2. **Identify the top 3 gaps** holding you back
3. **Give you specific next steps** to fix them

**No pitch. No sales pressure.** Just honest feedback from someone who's seen (and fixed) hundreds of broken strategies.

**Who this is for:**

- PMs/VPs who know their strategy needs work
- Founders building product for the first time
- Teams stuck in "feature factory" mode
- Anyone who scored <75% on the checklist

**Who this isn't for:**

- People looking for free consulting (I'll give you direction, not do the work)
- Teams not willing to make hard trade-offs
- Anyone just looking to pitch me

Pick a time. Show up. We'll talk strategy.

After 30 minutes, you'll know exactly what needs to change.

**Fair warning:**

I only do 5 of these per week. Spots fill up fast.

If you're serious about fixing your strategy, grab a time now.

Talk soon,

— Oliver
