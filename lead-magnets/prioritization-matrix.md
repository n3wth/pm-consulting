## The RICE Prioritization Matrix

Use this template to score and rank features using the RICE framework (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort).

### How to Use This Template

1. **List your features** in the first column
2. **Score Reach:** How many users will this affect? (raw number or percentage)
3. **Score Impact:** Massive=3x, High=2x, Medium=1x, Low=0.5x
4. **Score Confidence:** 100%, 80%, 50%, or 30%
5. **Estimate Effort:** In person-months
6. **Calculate Score:** (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
7. **Rank by score** (highest first)

### Feature Scoring Worksheet

| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort (mo) | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|------------|-------|----------|
| | | | | | = (R × I × C) / E | |
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |

### Guidance by Metric

**Reach Estimation:**
- Ask: "How many users/customers will this affect?"
- If unsure, segment: (Total users) × (% who have this problem)
- Be conservative over optimistic

**Impact Scoring:**
- 3x (Massive): Transforms how users work with the product
- 2x (High): Clear, measurable improvement in a key workflow
- 1x (Medium): Noticeable improvement, but incremental
- 0.5x (Minimal): Nice-to-have, marginal improvement

**Confidence Levels:**
- 100%: Strong data (customer research, usage data, market data)
- 80%: Fairly confident but could be tested more
- 50%: Educated guess based on limited signals
- 30%: Speculating (avoid scoring features this low)

**Effort Estimation:**
- Include: design, dev, QA, launch, support
- Add 20% buffer for unknowns
- If unsure, ask engineering and add their estimate + 30%

## Example Completed

For a SaaS analytics product:

| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|-------|----------|
| Onboarding redesign | 1500 | 3x | 80% | 2 | 1800 | #1 |
| Pre-built templates | 1200 | 2x | 70% | 1 | 1680 | #2 |
| Advanced search | 800 | 2x | 80% | 2 | 640 | #3 |
| Mobile app | 400 | 2x | 50% | 3 | 133 | #4 |
| Custom branding | 50 | 2x | 90% | 1 | 90 | #5 |

## Tips for Using RICE Effectively

1. **Don't be precise.** RICE is a ranking tool, not a prediction engine. Getting order-of-magnitude right is good enough.

2. **Revise quarterly.** As you learn more, revisit estimates. Features that seemed high-impact might drop as you learn more.

3. **Use it as input, not gospel.** RICE is a starting point for discussion, not a final decision.

4. **Weight by your constraints.** If you have limited design capacity, factor that into Effort. If customer relationships matter, weight Reach more heavily.

5. **Involve your team.** Don't score alone. Have engineers, design, and product estimate together. Disagreement reveals important information.
