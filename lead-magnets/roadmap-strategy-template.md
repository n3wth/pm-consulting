## Notes on Completing This Template

1. **Strategy Statement:** This should be one sentence that answers "What is this product?" and "Who is it for?" It's your north star.

2. **Annual Vision:** Describe what success looks like. Use concrete language. "We'll be the easiest-to-use analytics platform for non-technical teams" is better than "We'll be the best analytics product."

3. **Key Challenges:** Be honest. What's blocking your growth? What keeps you up at night? These become your strategic priorities.

4. **Q1-Q4 Priorities:** Each quarter should have ONE theme. This focus is what drives execution.

5. **Roadmap Detail:** NOW is detailed (features, names, dates). NEXT is medium detail. LATER is directional (themes, not feature names).
