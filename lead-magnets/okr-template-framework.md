# OKR Template + Framework

## The Complete Guide to Writing & Tracking Product OKRs

---

## What Are OKRs?

**Objectives and Key Results** - A goal-setting framework that connects vision to execution.

**Objective:** Where you're going (qualitative, inspiring)
**Key Results:** How you'll know you got there (quantitative, measurable)

---

## OKR Template Structure

### Company-Level OKR (Example)

**Objective:** Become the leading workflow automation platform for mid-market B2B companies

**Key Results:**
- KR1: Reach $10M ARR (from $6M)
- KR2: Achieve 95% annual net revenue retention
- KR3: Hit 50 NPS (from 42)
- KR4: Launch in 2 new verticals (healthcare, finance)

---

### Product Team OKR (Example)

**Objective:** Deliver exceptional onboarding experience that drives activation

**Key Results:**
- KR1: Increase Day 7 activation from 45% to 65%
- KR2: Reduce time-to-first-value from 4 days to <24 hours
- KR3: Achieve 4.5+ rating on onboarding satisfaction survey
- KR4: Ship self-serve onboarding flow (eliminate need for CS calls)

## The OKR Formula

### Writing Good Objectives

**Template:**
`[Action Verb] + [What] + [Why/Impact]`

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
- "Become the #1 choice for enterprise security teams"
- "Transform how developers ship code to production"
- "Make data analysis accessible to non-technical teams"

❌ **Bad:**
- "Improve the product" (too vague)
- "Launch 5 features" (that's a key result, not objective)
- "Increase revenue" (uninspiring, purely financial)

**Characteristics of good objectives:**
- Inspirational (team excited to work on it)
- Qualitative (directional, not numbered)
- Ambitious (stretches the team)
- Aligned (supports company strategy)

---

### Writing Good Key Results

**Template:**
`[Metric] from [Current] to [Target]`

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
- "Increase weekly active users from 10K to 25K"
- "Reduce P1 bugs from 15/week to <5/week"
- "Achieve 30% conversion rate on free-to-paid (from 18%)"
- "Launch V1 of mobile app with 4+ App Store rating"

❌ **Bad:**
- "Improve user engagement" (not measurable)
- "Ship redesign" (that's an output, not outcome)
- "Do user research" (that's an activity)
- "Be better than competitors" (not specific)

**Characteristics of good key results:**
- Measurable (specific number)
- Time-bound (achievable in quarter)
- Outcome-focused (not outputs/tasks)
- Ambitious but achievable (60-70% confidence)

## OKR Hierarchy: How They Connect

```
COMPANY OKR
  └─ Product OKR (supports company)
      └─ Team OKR (supports product)
          └─ Individual OKR (supports team)
```

**Example cascade:**

**Company:** "Become market leader in mid-market"
  ↓
**Product:** "Deliver features that win vs. competitors"
  ↓
**PM Team:** "Ship enterprise features by Q2"
  ↓
**Engineer:** "Build SSO integration by end of Q1"

## Quarterly OKR Template

### Q[X] 2026 OKRs

**Team/Department:** _____________

**Objective 1:** _____________

**Key Results:**
- [ ] KR1: _____________
- [ ] KR2: _____________
- [ ] KR3: _____________

**Owner:** _____________
**Timeline:** _____________
**Dependencies:** _____________

---

**Objective 2:** _____________

**Key Results:**
- [ ] KR1: _____________
- [ ] KR2: _____________
- [ ] KR3: _____________

**Owner:** _____________
**Timeline:** _____________
**Dependencies:** _____________

---

## OKR Grading Scale

**At end of quarter, grade each Key Result:**

- **0.0-0.3:** Didn't make meaningful progress (red)
- **0.4-0.6:** Made progress but didn't hit target (yellow)
- **0.7-1.0:** Hit or exceeded target (green)

**Example:**

KR: Increase DAU from 10K to 25K
- Actual result: 18K DAU
- Grade: 0.53 (yellow) — made progress, didn't hit target

**If you consistently hit 1.0 on all KRs: You're not being ambitious enough.**

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Limit to 3-5 OKRs per team/quarter
More than 5 = lack of focus

### 2. Each Objective should have 2-4 Key Results
More than 4 = too complex

### 3. OKRs should be challenging
Target 70% achievement (not 100%)

### 4. Review weekly
Don't set and forget — track progress

### 5. Don't tie OKRs to compensation
Makes people sandbag targets

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Confusing OKRs with Tasks

**Wrong:** KR: "Launch new feature"
**Right:** KR: "Increase user retention to 80% via new feature"

### Mistake 2: Too Many OKRs

**Wrong:** 8 objectives, 25 key results
**Right:** 3 objectives, 9 key results

### Mistake 3: No Clear Owner

**Wrong:** "Team will figure it out"
**Right:** Sarah (PM) owns this OKR

### Mistake 4: Purely Vanity Metrics

**Wrong:** KR: "Get 100K signups"
**Right:** KR: "Get 100K signups with 40% activation rate"
