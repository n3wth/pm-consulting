# Product Strategy Checklist

## The Essential Framework for Building & Evaluating Product Strategy

Use this checklist to audit your existing strategy or build a new one from scratch.

---

## Part 1: Problem Definition

- [ ] **Clear problem statement** - Can you explain the problem in one sentence?
- [ ] **Target persona defined** - Who specifically has this problem? (not "businesses")
- [ ] **Problem severity documented** - How painful is this problem? (time/money/frustration)
- [ ] **Current alternatives identified** - What do people use today? Why isn't it good enough?
- [ ] **Market timing validated** - Why is now the right time to solve this?

**Red Flag:** If you can't answer all five clearly, your strategy is built on shaky ground.

---

## Part 2: Vision & Direction

- [ ] **3-year vision articulated** - Where are you going? (not just what you're building)
- [ ] **Success definition** - What does "winning" look like? (specific metrics)
- [ ] **Market position** - What category do you own? (how do customers describe you?)
- [ ] **Strategic narrative** - Can the team explain the vision in 2 minutes?
- [ ] **Vision stability** - Has your vision changed in the last 6 months? (red flag if yes)

**Red Flag:** Vision that changes quarterly = no vision at all.

---

## Part 3: Competitive Advantage

- [ ] **Moat identified** - Why will you win vs. competitors?
- [ ] **Moat durability** - Can competitors copy it in 6 months? (if yes, it's not a moat)
- [ ] **Defensibility proof** - What data/evidence shows your advantage is real?
- [ ] **Advantage timeline** - How long will this advantage last? (2 years minimum)
- [ ] **Reinforcement plan** - How does your moat get stronger over time?

**Moat Types:**
- ✅ Network effects (product improves with more users)
- ✅ Data moat (unique dataset competitors can't replicate)
- ✅ Brand/distribution (customer acquisition advantage)
- ✅ Technical breakthrough (genuinely hard to build)
- ❌ "Better execution" (not a moat)
- ❌ "Superior technology" (gets copied)
- ❌ "We care more" (everyone says this)

---

## Part 4: Strategic Trade-Offs

- [ ] **Explicit "No" list** - What are you choosing NOT to do?
- [ ] **Market segment focus** - Which customers are you saying no to?
- [ ] **Feature scope** - Which features are explicitly out of scope?
- [ ] **Channel strategy** - Which go-to-market channels are you avoiding?
- [ ] **Trade-off clarity** - Can every team member explain your top 3 trade-offs?

**Test:** If your strategy doesn't disappoint someone, it's not a strategy.

---

## Part 5: Critical Assumptions

- [ ] **Assumptions documented** - What must be true for this strategy to work?
- [ ] **Validation plan** - How will you test each assumption?
- [ ] **Falsifiability** - Can each assumption be proven wrong? (if not, it's not an assumption)
- [ ] **Timeline defined** - When will you know if assumptions are valid?
- [ ] **Pivot triggers** - What data would cause you to change strategy?

**Example Assumptions:**
- "Users will pay $50/month for this solution"
- "We can acquire customers for <$500 CAC via content"
- "Engineering can ship MVP in 6 months with current team"
- "Target persona has budget authority without VP approval"

---

## Part 6: Metrics & Success Criteria

- [ ] **North Star metric** - What single metric best represents value delivery?
- [ ] **Leading indicators** - What predicts future success? (daily/weekly tracked)
- [ ] **Lagging indicators** - What confirms you're winning? (monthly/quarterly tracked)
- [ ] **Threshold definitions** - What numbers indicate success vs. failure?
- [ ] **Metric stability** - Have your core metrics been stable for 6+ months?

**Red Flag:** Metrics that change every quarter = no strategic clarity.

---

## Part 7: Resource Allocation

- [ ] **Budget alignment** - Does budget reflect strategic priorities? (show me the money)
- [ ] **Team structure** - Are teams organized around strategic pillars?
- [ ] **Roadmap connection** - Does roadmap directly serve strategy? (not random features)
- [ ] **Capacity match** - Can you actually execute this strategy with current resources?
- [ ] **Investment thesis** - Where are you doubling down? Where are you divesting?

**Test:** If engineering allocation doesn't match strategic priorities, strategy is fiction.

---

## Part 8: Stakeholder Alignment

- [ ] **Executive buy-in** - Do all execs agree on strategy? (verbal + written)
- [ ] **Team understanding** - Can front-line team members explain strategy?
- [ ] **Decision framework** - Do teams use strategy to make daily decisions?
- [ ] **Conflict resolution** - When priorities conflict, does strategy provide answer?
- [ ] **Review cadence** - Is strategy reviewed quarterly? (not just annual exercise)

**Red Flag:** Strategy lives in a deck that nobody references = not real strategy.

---

## Part 9: Market & Competitive Context

- [ ] **Market size validated** - TAM/SAM/SOM with bottom-up math (not top-down)
- [ ] **Competitive landscape mapped** - Who are your top 3 competitors?
- [ ] **Competitive advantages documented** - Why would customers choose you?
- [ ] **Threat assessment** - What could kill your strategy? (new entrants, tech shifts)
- [ ] **Market timing** - Why is this the right 3-year window?

---

## Part 10: Execution Principles

- [ ] **How we work** - What principles guide how you build/ship?
- [ ] **Quality bar** - What's your definition of "good enough"?
- [ ] **Speed vs. quality balance** - When do you move fast vs. slow?
- [ ] **Risk tolerance** - What risks are acceptable? What aren't?
- [ ] **Decision-making** - Who decides what? (RACI clarity)

---

## Scoring Your Strategy

**Count your checkmarks:**

**40-48 checks (90%+):** Excellent strategy
- You have a real, executable strategy
- Keep refining and executing

**32-39 checks (75-90%):** Good strategy with gaps
- You're close, but gaps exist
- Focus on sections with lowest scores

**24-31 checks (50-75%):** Strategy needs major work
- Significant gaps in strategic thinking
- Revisit core assumptions and trade-offs

**<24 checks (<50%):** This isn't a strategy yet
- You have a roadmap or vision, not a strategy
- Start from Part 1 and rebuild

---

## Next Steps

### If you scored <75%:

1. **Schedule strategy workshop** - Get key stakeholders in room for 4 hours
2. **Focus on weakest sections** - Don't try to fix everything at once
3. **Rewrite and circulate** - Document decisions, get written agreement
4. **Review in 30 days** - Re-score to track improvement

### If you scored 75%+:

1. **Document in writing** - Turn this into a 3-4 page strategy doc
2. **Communicate widely** - Every team member should read it
3. **Tie to OKRs** - Ensure quarterly goals ladder to strategy
4. **Review quarterly** - Strategy isn't static; update as you learn
