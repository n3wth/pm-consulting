# The Product Manager's Decision Matrix
## Decide Faster. Ship Better. Grow Revenue.

This framework helps you evaluate features, prioritize work, and align stakeholders in under 30 minutes.

## How to Use This

1. **Get your team together.** Product, Engineering, Customer Success. 30 minutes max.
2. **Pick a feature to evaluate.** Use this matrix to score it.
3. **Score on each dimension.** 1-5 scale (1=low, 5=high).
4. **Calculate the total.** Multiply by weight percentages below.
5. **Compare across features.** Higher score = higher priority.

## The Decision Matrix

| Dimension | Weight | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | Score |
|-----------|--------|---|---|---|---|---|-------|
| **User Impact** | 30% | Breaks nothing | Minor improvement | Solves a real problem | Solves the top problem | Category-defining | _/5 |
| **Revenue Potential** | 25% | No impact | Minimal ($100K) | Moderate ($250K+) | Strong ($500K+) | Massive ($1M+) | _/5 |
| **Implementation Cost** | 20% | Trivial (1 sprint) | Light (2 sprints) | Medium (1 quarter) | Heavy (2 quarters) | Massive (3+ quarters) | _/5 |
| **Customer Requests** | 15% | Nobody asked | Few asked | Several asked | Many asked | Critical/urgent | _/5 |
| **Competitive Pressure** | 10% | We're ahead | Nice to have | Keeps us current | Catching up | Falling behind | _/5 |

**Total Score = (User Impact × 0.30) + (Revenue × 0.25) + (Cost × 0.20) + (Requests × 0.15) + (Competition × 0.10)**

**Maximum Score: 5.0**

## Interpretation

- **4.5-5.0:** Ship immediately. Top priority.
- **3.5-4.4:** Ship in next quarter. High priority.
- **2.5-3.4:** Consider shipping. Medium priority.
- **1.5-2.4:** Deprioritize. Low priority.
- **<1.5:** Don't build. Archive for future.

## Example: Feature Evaluation

### Feature: "Custom Workflow Builder"

| Dimension | Reasoning | Score |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **User Impact** | Solves our #1 support ticket category (automation). Multiple customers have asked for this specific feature. | 5 |
| **Revenue** | Can justify $2M+ in additional ARR based on customer conversations. Enterprise deals hinging on this. | 5 |
| **Implementation** | Complex, but our team has done similar work. Estimate 6 weeks. | 3 |
| **Requests** | 12 customer requests in last 3 months. All enterprise. | 5 |
| **Competition** | 3 competitors have this. We're missing a table-stake feature. | 4 |

**Total: (5×0.30) + (5×0.25) + (3×0.20) + (5×0.15) + (4×0.10) = 1.5 + 1.25 + 0.6 + 0.75 + 0.4 = 4.5**

**Recommendation: Ship immediately.**

### Feature: "Dark Mode"

| Dimension | Reasoning | Score |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **User Impact** | Nice to have. No user problems solved. Cosmetic. | 2 |
| **Revenue** | Zero revenue impact. | 1 |
| **Implementation** | Fairly easy. 2 weeks of work. | 4 |
| **Requests** | 2 casual mentions over the year. Not a demand signal. | 2 |
| **Competition** | Competitors have it, but not a differentiator. | 2 |

**Total: (2×0.30) + (1×0.25) + (4×0.20) + (2×0.15) + (2×0.10) = 0.6 + 0.25 + 0.8 + 0.3 + 0.2 = 2.15**

**Recommendation: Deprioritize. Ship when you have excess capacity.**

## Key Principle: Implementation Cost is Inverted

Notice: **High implementation cost actually reduces priority.**

This is intentional. A feature that:
- Drives $500K revenue (5)
- Costs 3 quarters to build (2 score)

...might not be worth it compared to:
- Drives $250K revenue (3)
- Takes 1 sprint (5 score)

Why? Because you ship 4 $250K features in the time it takes to ship one $500K feature.

## How to Use This in Your Team

**Monthly Backlog Grooming:**
Gather your team. Rate every top-20 feature on the matrix. Takes 60 minutes. You'll kill 30-40% of your backlog immediately.

**Sprint Planning:**
Before each sprint, rate proposed work. Features under 2.5 only ship if engineering has slack.

**Stakeholder Conversations:**
When someone proposes a pet project, use the matrix. It removes politics.

"I know you love this feature, but the matrix shows it's not a priority right now. Here's why. Let's prove these dimensions wrong and we'll reconsider."

## Customize for Your Business

This template weights dimensions 30/25/20/15/10. Your business might be different:

**Enterprise SaaS?** Increase Customer Requests weight to 25%, decrease Competitive Pressure to 5%.

**Venture-backed Startup?** Increase Revenue Potential to 35%, decrease Implementation Cost weight to 10%.

**Developer Tools?** Increase Competitive Pressure to 20%, decrease Customer Requests to 10%.

Adjust the matrix to match your strategy. The principle stays the same: make decisions explicit.

## Red Flags You're Not Using This

❌ "We're building that because the CEO wants it" (no matrix analysis)  
❌ "That feature has been on the roadmap for 8 months" (no prioritization)  
❌ "We're not sure why we prioritize engineering debt over customer features" (no framework)  
❌ "Our roadmap changes every week" (no decision-making discipline)

**Pro Tip:** Use this monthly. Update your weights if you find they're misaligned with your business outcomes. After 3 months, you'll have built institutional muscle around prioritization.

Your team will make better decisions. Engineering will complain less. Your roadmap will actually ship.
