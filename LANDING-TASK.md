## Technical Implementation
Use one of:
1. **Carrd** (free tier) - fastest, good enough
2. **Notion public page** - zero code, instant
3. **Simple HTML** - host on GitHub Pages

## Stripe Setup
Create payment links for:
- $300/hr session (1 hour)
- $500 PM hiring package
- $2000/month advisory (subscription)

## Deliverables
1. `/revenue-sprint/pm-consulting/landing-page.html` (or URL if using Carrd/Notion)
2. `/revenue-sprint/pm-consulting/stripe-links.json` with payment URLs
3. `/revenue-sprint/pm-consulting/LANDING-PAGE-COPY.md` (all copy for Oliver's approval)

## Design Constraints
- Mobile-friendly
- Fast load (<2 sec)
- Clear CTA above fold
- Professional but not corporate
- No stock photos (use Oliver's real photo if available)

## Timeline
- Complete within 6 hours
- Get Oliver approval on copy before going live
- Deploy and share URL

## Success Criteria
- Loads fast + looks professional
- Clear value proposition
- Easy to book/pay
- Oliver approves before launch
